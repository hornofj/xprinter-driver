CUPS driver for thermal printer Xprinter

Tested with model XP-C260H, should work with most others as well.

The linux driver provided on Xprinter site unfortunately doesn't work.
PPDs are correct but the raster filter is not.

This driver is based on the similar one by [@klirichek](https://github.com/klirichek) and his [filters for Zjiang](https://github.com/klirichek/zj-58).
